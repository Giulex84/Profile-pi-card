# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

Profile Pi Card respects user privacy and is designed following a **privacy-by-design** approach.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

Profile Pi Card collects only the minimum data required to function:

- Pi username (via Pi Network Authentication)
- Internal Pi user identifier (UID)
- User-created activity proofs

No additional personal information is collected.

---

## 2. How Information Is Used

Collected information is used solely to:

- Authenticate the user via Pi Network
- Display the user’s profile card
- Associate activity proofs with the authenticated user
- Allow the user to export their own data

---

## 3. Data Storage

- Activity proofs are stored **locally** in the user’s browser
- No automatic transmission of proofs to external servers
- No third-party analytics or tracking tools are used

---

## 4. Data Sharing

Profile Pi Card does **not**:

- Share user data with third parties
- Publish user profiles publicly
- Index user data for discovery
- Sell or monetize personal data

Any data sharing occurs only if explicitly initiated by the user (e.g. exporting their own data).

---

## 5. Security

Authentication is handled using the official Pi Network SDK.  
The app does not store Pi account credentials.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Profile Pi Card does not knowingly collect data from children under the age required by Pi Network policies.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect improvements or regulatory requirements.  
Changes will be published within the repository.

---

## 8. Contact

For privacy-related questions, please contact the developer via the Pi Network developer portal.
