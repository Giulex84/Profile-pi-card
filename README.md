# Profile Pi Card

Profile Pi Card is a **private, identity-gated journaling utility** designed specifically for Pi Network users.

It provides a simple, respectful space where users can record and reflect on how they interact with the Pi ecosystem over time.

This app is intentionally minimal, privacy-first, and fully compliant with Pi Network guidelines.

## Why this app exists for Pi users

Pi grows through individual exploration, learning, and participation.

Profile Pi Card exists to help Pi users:

- build awareness of their personal Pi activity
- reflect on how they use Pi apps, features, and community tools
- create a private record of their journey inside the Pi ecosystem

The app focuses on **personal clarity**, not social exposure.

## What users can do

After authenticating with Pi, users can:

- log Pi-related activities (usage, learning, exploration, contribution)
- add optional personal notes
- review their activity history over time
- see a narrative timeline generated from their own actions

All data remains local to the user’s device.

## What this app does NOT do

- No public profiles
- No social feeds
- No content sharing
- No payments or transfers
- No rewards or gamification
- No analytics or tracking
- No cloud storage

Profile Pi Card is intentionally scoped to avoid unnecessary complexity.
